      <div class="project">
        <h3 style="background-color: #000000; color:white">Portfolio Web</h3>
        <p>
          This project is my own web portfolio, designed and developed using
          HTML and CSS. The main objective of the portfolio is to showcase my
          skills, experience, and notable projects in an attractive and
          accessible manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The portfolio design focuses on usability and aesthetics, employing a
          combination of elegant colors and a clean, modern layout. The
          portfolio structure is organized into clear sections, such as the home
          page, project section, and contact information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding development, best practices of HTML and CSS have been
          utilized to ensure clean and optimized code. Semantic HTML has been
          employed to enhance accessibility and search engine indexing.
          Additionally, CSS has been applied to add custom styles, such as
          typography, colors, grid layouts, and subtle visual effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my web portfolio, visitors can explore my personal
          information, learn about my skills and projects, and get in touch with
          me for job opportunities or collaborations. I have also ensured that
          the portfolio is responsive, meaning it adapts and looks great on
          different devices and screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This web portfolio project represents my passion for web design and
          development, as well as my dedication to showcasing my skills and
          accomplishments to potential employers or clients. I am proud to have
